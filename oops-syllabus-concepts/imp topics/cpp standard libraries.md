### C++ Standard Library
The C++ Standard Library can be categorized into two parts −

<strong>The Standard Function Library</strong> − This library consists of general-purpose,stand-alone functions that are not part of any class. The function library is inherited from C.

<strong>The Object Oriented Class Library</strong> − This is a collection of classes and associated functions.

Standard C++ Library incorporates all the Standard C libraries also, with small additions and changes to support type safety

### The Standard Function Library
The standard function library is divided into the following categories −

1. I/O,
2. String and character handling,
3. Mathematical,
4. Time, date, and localization,
5. Dynamic allocation,
6. Miscellaneous,
7. Wide-character functions,

### The Object Oriented Class Library
Standard C++ Object Oriented Library defines an extensive set of classes that provide support for a number of common activities, including I/O, strings, and numeric processing. This library includes the following −

1. The Standard C++ I/O Classes
2. The String Class
3. The Numeric Classes
4. The STL Container Classes
5. The STL Algorithms
6. The STL Function Objects
7. The STL Iterators
8. The STL Allocators
9. The Localization library
10. Exception Handling Classes
11. Miscellaneous Support Library
